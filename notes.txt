Just finished watching 'TPB AFK'. Wish to test my own meagre skills.

I'm an imbecile. Bencoding is not a CFG.

Consider:

    (gdb) p dict_val
        $2 = {po_type = T_BYTESTRING, po_stringval = "http:", po_intval = "", po_listval = std::vector of length 0, capacity 0, 
      po_dictval = std::map with 0 elements}

the parser does not get the full announce string
string.find is supposed to find the first index
so why does the string stop after "http:"?

SUSPICION   ->  definitely std::string::find
...

SOLUTION -> I had intended for the crunching functions to give
    indices while I treated those return values as lengths in the
    parsing funcs. Easy to solve.
